            <p>In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare variables and that was using the var
                keyword. However, there were some issues associated with variables declared using the var keyword so it
                was necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration. With the advent of ES6, now developers are
                able to define variables according to their specific needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const.

                All three of these three keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring variables. However,
                they differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in the next section.</p>
            The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
            Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
            Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in
            their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
            Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the
            immediate enclosing block.

            Let us now discuss, in detail, how these keywords can make a developerâ€™s code more efficient and how to use
            each keyword to declare variables in JavaScript programs.

            <h1>2.Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions</h1>
            <p>While both the regular and arrow syntaxes define functions, when would you choose one instead of another?
                That's a good question.

                In this post, I'll show the main differences between the two, so you could choose the right syntax for
                your needs. <br>
                Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.

                The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript,
                there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.

            <h1>3..forEach(), .map(), .filter(). What's the difference?</h1>
            <p>
                .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array
                and it returns undefined. <br>
                .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                elements. <br>
                .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
                with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
